# Breast-Cancer-Image-Segmentation
## Project Aim:
The aim of the project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify breast ultrasound images into three classes: normal, benign, and malignant. This can aid in the early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer, which is crucial for improving patient outcomes and reducing mortality rates.

## Importance:
Breast cancer is a major public health concern worldwide, and early detection is crucial for successful treatment. Ultrasound imaging is a widely used diagnostic tool in breast cancer detection, but the interpretation of these images can be challenging for human radiologists. Developing an accurate machine learning model for classifying breast ultrasound images can help improve diagnostic accuracy, reduce the need for unnecessary biopsies, and ultimately save lives.

## Data Source:
The dataset used for this project is the Breast Ultrasound Dataset, which was collected in 2018 and includes ultrasound images of 600 female patients between the ages of 25 and 75. The dataset contains 780 images in PNG format, with an average image size of 500*500 pixels. The images are categorized into three classes: normal, benign, and malignant, and the ground truth images are provided alongside the original images.

For this project i used a dataset from kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aryashah2k/breast-ultrasound-images-dataset
